- Hooks
- Effect
- Components
- Immutability
- Events
- Forms
- Lifting state up
- Passing props down
- Using APIs & fetch
- Custom hooks
- Restoring from localStorage
- React Router
and many more!

This project was created as a practise to a react self-learning challenge.

![About us](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13730487/106376612-1bcfce00-63eb-11eb-93ee-193f18924b93.png)
The 'store' location is labelled with a marker through mapboxgl in About us page. 

![Products](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13730487/106376615-1f635500-63eb-11eb-8999-57b8dc9fc882.png)
Products' information can be fetched thought API and display in Product Page. 
And products can be added/removed into/from the cart by pressing buttons.

![Cart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13730487/106376613-1d999180-63eb-11eb-9011-c2d72fc6ee70.png)
Cart page is where the client can see a breakdown of the products they ordered, as well as the quantity for each product. 

![Checkout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13730487/106376614-1ecabe80-63eb-11eb-95d0-db6d6bbf0af3.png)
Stripe Checkout is also embedded within the project but unfortunately there's sth wrong with the price_id we retrieved from the API. 
Will work on it soon!
