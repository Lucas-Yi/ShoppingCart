- Hooks
- Effect
- Components
- Immutability
- Events
- Forms
- Lifting state up
- Passing props down
- Using APIs & fetch
- Custom hooks
- Restoring from localStorage
- React Router
and many more!

## Features

This project was created as a practise to a react self-learning challenge.

![About us](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13730487/106377642-93552b80-63f2-11eb-9325-906bf41d323d.png)
The 'store' location is labelled with a marker through mapboxgl in About us page. 

![Products](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13730487/106377647-95b78580-63f2-11eb-975f-0822fc852ad6.png)
Products' information can be fetched thought API and display in Product Page. 
And products can be added/removed into/from the cart by pressing buttons.

![Cart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13730487/106377643-951eef00-63f2-11eb-9cd5-a07f2b1eef57.png)
Cart page is where the client can see a breakdown of the products they ordered, as well as the quantity for each product. 

![Checkout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13730487/106377644-951eef00-63f2-11eb-8bbd-72f67843fbe7.png)
Stripe Checkout is also embedded within the project but unfortunately there's sth wrong with the price_id we retrieved from the API. 
Will work on it soon!
