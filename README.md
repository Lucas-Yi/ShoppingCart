Building this E-Commerce is excited since you can see the improvements by adding features one by one :)\
I've gained a lot through this comprehensive project and become familiar with the following React concepts:
- JSX
- Props
- State
- Hooks
- Effect
- Components
- Immutability
- Events
- Forms
- Lifting state up
- Passing props down
- Using APIs & fetch
- Custom hooks
- Restoring from localStorage
- React Router
and many more!

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)


## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This project was created as a practise to a react self-learning challenge. \

The 'store' location is labelled with a marker through mapboxgl in ![About us]() page. \

Products' information can be fetched thought API and display in ![Products]() page. \
And products can be added/removed into/from the cart by pressing buttons.

Cart page ![Cart]() is where the client can see a breakdown of the products they ordered, as well as the quantity for each product. \

Stripe Checkout is also embedded within the project but unfortunately there's sth wrong with the price_id we retrieved from the API. \
Will work on it soon!
